## About the Project

This repository provides a set of scripts and tools aimed at automating **metadata extraction** and performing **security assessments** using forensic analysis. The project includes **Bash scripts** for automating administrative tasks and **Python utilities** to extract, manage, and analyze metadata from files. Additionally, it incorporates several **digital forensic tools** to maintain data quality and integrity during investigations, such as **Sleuth Kit**, **ExifTool**, and **Hayabusa**.

The project emphasizes **data governance** and **security**, ensuring that captured data remains well-structured and accurate, especially when working with sensitive or critical information.

---

## Features

- **Metadata Extraction**: Automatically extracts metadata from files, including timestamps, file properties, and user details, using **ExifTool** and **Python**.
- **Security and Forensics**: Includes tools like **Sleuth Kit** and **Hayabusa** for forensic analysis, ensuring data quality and lineage.
- **Bash Automation**: Automates backup and data management tasks using predefined **Bash scripts**.
- **Tool Integration**: Combines industry-standard tools for seamless security automation and metadata management.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Bash** (for executing shell scripts)
- **ExifTool** (for metadata extraction)
- **Sleuth Kit** (for forensic analysis)

---

## How to Run

### 1. Metadata Extraction with ExifTool

To extract metadata from files using the Python script:

```bash
python exif-tool-working.py [file_path]
```

Replace `[file_path]` with the path of the file from which you want to extract metadata.

This script automates the **metadata capture** process, ensuring the extraction of key information like timestamps and file properties, which are essential for data governance and quality assurance.

### 2. Forensic Analysis with Sleuth Kit

Navigate to the `sleuth_kit/` directory and follow the instructions to perform forensic tasks such as disk image analysis. The **Sleuth Kit** allows for structured investigation into file systems, maintaining data quality and lineage—a critical part of any digital investigation or data governance process.


---

## Tools Description

- **ExifTool**: A powerful tool used for extracting and editing metadata from various file formats. It ensures **data capture** is precise and automated, making it easier to handle large datasets with accuracy and efficiency.

- **Sleuth Kit**: A set of tools for analyzing disk images and recovering forensic evidence. It ensures **data lineage** is maintained, supporting data integrity throughout investigations.

- **Hayabusa**: This tool is designed for analyzing Windows event logs. It provides deep insight into system events, supporting the **data security** component by identifying threats and anomalies.

- **Hachoir**: A Python library that parses binary files, allowing for **metadata extraction** across a wide range of file types.

## Data Management & Security

This project demonstrates practical exposure to **data management** and **security** through:

1. **Metadata Capture**: Automated metadata extraction from files using **ExifTool** and Python. Capturing key file information (timestamps, properties) ensures data governance and lineage.

2. **Data Governance**: Tools like **Sleuth Kit** ensure the traceability and integrity of sensitive data throughout the forensic analysis. This is critical in maintaining structured and reliable data.

3. **Data Security**: Tools like **Hayabusa** and **Sleuth Kit** work with sensitive data to perform security assessments, ensuring data integrity during the investigation of security incidents.

4. **Tool Integration**: The integration of **ExifTool**, **Sleuth Kit**, and **Hayabusa** provides a complete workflow for managing, analyzing, and securing data. This highlights experience with data governance, ensuring data quality, security, and proper metadata capture during operations.
